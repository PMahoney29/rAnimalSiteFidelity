# rAnimalSiteFidelity

rASF, a program developed for assessing animal site fidelity using program R.  
The software provides the flexibility to identify various forms of clustering
in animal relocation data.  In addition, the software provides some functionality to
integrate behavioral state estimates derived using behavioral change point analysis
from R package 'bcpa' and K-means clustering. See rASF_ExampleCode.R for specifics.

I plan to convert the functions contained herein into an R package at some point in the 
near future.  Stay tuned!!
